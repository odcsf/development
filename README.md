# development

The purpose of this repository is to record and share code written at ODC so that coworkers, and maybe even other non-profits, can easily access and use this work if they so desire. This repository will primarily contain various python scripts to be run from command line, although the long term dream would be to create GUI's and overall improve useability for non-programming users. 

While this repository is owned by odcsf, it is currently maintained/operated/used by just @hannahsayswhy, so please direct any questions to her.
